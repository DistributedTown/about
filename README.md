# Distributed Town
DistributedTown is a Network of interconnected, self-sovereign Communities. It allows anyone to join one or create their own, and it's based on DiTo, a non-speculative mutual credit system, & SkillWallet, a universal, pseudonymous ID based on skills rather than personal data.

# Vision 
Distributed Town aims to build a new financial ecosystem, supported by self-sustainable (and self-sovereign) community-hubs, with self-sovereign, pseudonymous identity management. For members to exchange skills with each other - safely, and without speculation - and collectively build the future of Collaborative Economics.

# Core values:
1. Self-organization and sustainability
2. Skills as a currency. 
3. Collective autonomy (Inter-Independency). 

The project aims to bring DAO’s ease of use to local and online communities through a one-step onboarding process, and an intuitive UX that mimics the urban environment.

# How it works:
## Roles:
1. On one side, Members of a community have more mobility and access while traveling. Our SkillWallet allows a seamless onboarding and verification in any other community, project, hackathon or event in the Network. We designed a brand-new approach to ID-verification, based on Skills and Contribution, rather than personal data. This way, in order to earn, contribute and participate, people won't need for passports, résumés or bank accounts ever again.

2. On the other side, local-/online-communities can quickly attract the skills they need, proposing gigs (using a mutual credit system), and a proximity-signal based on a mathematical random walk model. Also, by using [**Q2T (QuadraticTreasury)**](https://github.com/q2t-fund) they can create brand-new projects from scratch, both to (a) distribute tasks efficiently, and (b) attracting the funds needed, by co-staking stablecoins to fund in-network innovation. This spares communities/projects the time that they would have wasted in tiring and bureaucratic processes to attract grants and external expertise.

## Specifics:
- Each community has its own ID
- Each contributor has a unique Skill-Wallet, with the credits they have earned. They will be able to use it in other communities while they relocate/travel, just scanning a QR-code (no passports, résumés or bank accounts needed).
- Each community has a __“scarcity score”__ - based on the *“variety coefficient”* of the skillset available internally. This will automatically send a __“signal”__ to the closest community when they have excess/lack of one specific skill. 

- Close-communities will be indexed per *skill-proximity* based on a __DiTo SubGraph__, and they can scale together by sharing the skills more needed to realize a project or a task, following a “one-step random walk” model.
